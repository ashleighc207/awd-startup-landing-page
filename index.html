            <p>Tired of the local park or strolls around the neighborhood, but don't know where to go?
                Us, too. That's why we created Heik - a hub to explore new places with genuine feedback from
                real people. With detailed descriptions, hours, locations, and so much more, your next Heik
                has never been so easy!

            <h3 class="title"> What is a Heik? </h3>
            <p> A Heik is a specific destination - ranging from the lowest valley to the highest peak. Each
                Heik comes with basic information about the destination, including (the most important part)
                level of pet-friendly!

                    <i class="fa fa-paw fa-4x"></i><h4>Pet Approval</h4>
                    <p> So what if <em>you</em> like the Heik, all that truly matters is that your
                        furry (or not so furry, we don't judge!) friend can enjoy the Heik with you. Our
                        pet approval stamp weighs factors such as available doggy bags, water fill
                    up stations, breed restrictions, and many more!</p>

                    <p> Heiking alone can be a peaceful time to collect your thoughts. On the other hand,
                        you can open the app and see Heik'rs near you that want to meet up! Explore new
                        places while making new friends along the way. Plus, who else will understand your
                    wilderness horror stories?</p>

                    <p>In addition to our Pet Approval stamp, we also rate our parks using a 3-factor
                        weighted rating. Our rating includes what the community has rated it as, what our
                        team has rated it as, and an objective review of all facilities, activities, and even
                    accessibility.</p>

                    <p> Maybe you enjoy planning your trips online, but, let's be real. When you're on
                        a Heik, it's just you, the wilderness, and your cellphone. Open up the Heik app while
                        on a Heik to see where the nearest bathroom is, which trail you're on, how far you
                    have Heik'd, and more!</p>
